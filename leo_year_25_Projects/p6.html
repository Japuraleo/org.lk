      <p id="title"> Project Name: Chai Stall </p>
      <br>
      <p>On 23rd September, our Leo Club of District 306 D7 University of Sri Jayewardenepura 
        organized a chai stall as part of our fundraising efforts. <br><br>
        Our enthusiastic members and committed project coordinators worked together to make the stall look stunning and run efficiently.  
        The event garnered a lot of interest and helped us raise a respectable amount of money, which will go directly toward our next events and worthwhile community service activities.  
        <br><br>It was more than just a fundraising event; it was a time of unity, ingenuity, and collaboration that demonstrated the Leoism spirit and the dedication we uphold as a community.</p>

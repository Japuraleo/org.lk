    <p id="title"> Project Name: Leo Photo Shoot</p>
    <br>
    <p>We recently held a memorable photo shoot with the full board of Leo Club officers, 
      bringing together around 54 dedicated members including the executive board, directors, 
      pressure coordinators, and all supporting crews. It was more than just a photo 
      session â€” it was a moment that strengthened our bonds, built unity, and reminded us 
      of the shared commitment we carry. Getting to know each other better as one strong team, 
      the energy and dedication captured that day continues to drive our journey forward.</p>

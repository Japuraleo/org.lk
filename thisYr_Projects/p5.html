    <p> Encouraging creativity may help us understand and sympathize with others, especially 
      in a divided society. Creativity serves as a guiding light, pulling us away from violence 
      and toward kindness and compassion, ultimately replacing hatred with love. Despite our many 
      feelings, such as sadness, anguish, pleasure, or happiness, we are unified. Sharing viewpoints 
      through writing, poetry, and art is an effective approach to increasing awareness and appreciation 
      for our environment. Many people nowadays desire to be writers since it allows them to share their 
      expertise openly and professionally, even with strangers. The ultimate goal of the Archoden initiative
       is to increase the literacy of our club members. We hope that through artistic expression, we may 
       bridge gaps, increase understanding, and foster a sense of community.</p>

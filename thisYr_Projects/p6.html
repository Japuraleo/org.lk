    <br>
    <p>Encouraging creativity may foster empathy and understanding in a divided society.
       Creativity guides us away from violence and towards kindness and
        compassion, finally replacing hatred with love. Despite our many emotions, such as despair, 
        agony, pleasure, or happiness, we are together. Sharing perspectives via writing, poetry, and 
        art may raise understanding and respect for the environment. Many individuals today want to be 
        writers because they can share their knowledge openly and professionally, even with strangers. 
        The ultimate purpose of the Discover project is to improve the literacy of our club members. We
         hope that through artistic expression, we may transcend barriers, improve understanding, and 
         build a feeling of community.</p>

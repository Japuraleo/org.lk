    <p id="title"> Project Name: Regreen Sri Lanka</p>
    <br>
    <p>The REGREEN SRI LANKA project, held on January 28th, 2024, 
      involved 20 Leos in an awareness program, bird-watching session, 
      field visit, mangrove plantation, and waste management activities. 
      The project aimed to create a sustainable impact on Muthurajawela 
      Wetland and its surrounding community. Permission was obtained from 
      the Muthurajawela Visiting Centre manager, and social media was used
       to spread the project's message.Mangrove plants were collected from 
      near Ja Ela, and refreshment orders were given to relevant people. 
      The day began with an awareness program.

      The community was urged to understand the significance of wetland 
      ecosystems, wildlife conservation, and sustainable living practices. 
      A boat ride was conducted, and participants were guided by staff to 
      collect garbage from the Negombo lagoon area. The waste management 
      program involved collecting garbage bags and rubber gloves, and 
      observing water pollution affecting plants and the ecosystem. 
      After completing the mangrove plantation, participants participated 
      in bird-watching sessions and field visits. Muthurajawela wetland is 
      home to many threatened species, including 40 known fish species, 45% 
      of native inland fish species in Sri Lanka, and 22 endemic mammals, 
      including the globally endangered grey slender loris. The restoration 
      of the wetland contributes to protecting these important endemic and 
      threatened species. By taking this initiative, the community can 
      contribute to the protection of these vital ecosystems</p>
